        <strong>Basalt fabric</strong> â€“ for structural uses, basalt fabrics are useful for producing structural basalt-plastics based on various thermosetting binders (for instance by laying out method). From these materials components automobiles, aircraft, ships and households appliances can be produced. In the case of preliminary metallization of the fabrics, the resulting basalt-plastic acquires shield properties against electromagnetic radiation. Also basalt fabrics can be used as basics when producing soft and rigid roofing. Basalt fabrics for electro technical purposes are used as a base for the production of insulation materials. These materials are employed in the production of substances for printed circuit boards for electronics and electrical engineering. These have superior properties to similar conventional components made of fiberglass.

      General-purpose fabrics are useful, for example in fire feltings for suppression of extremely complex fires resulting from ignition of highly flammable liquids, in particular gasoline. The employments of incombustible basalt fabric inserts in industrial ventilators increase their fire safety as well as the fire resistance of ventilating systems. The cost of basalt fabrics is considerable lower than that of similar materials. The non-combustible properties of basalt woven materials enable it to resist flames for long periods that make basalt tapes effective as an extra fine resistant insulation for electrical cables and underground ducts. Basalt-fabrics hoses may be useful for reinforcing cables, repairing the interior and exterior of tubes and pipelines. Most fabrics are made by weaving or knitting yarns together. Non-woven fabrics are made by bonding or felting fibers together. A fabric's appearance, properties and end-use can be affected by the way it was constructed.
